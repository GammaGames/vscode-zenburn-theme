# VS Code Zenburn Theme

> Zenburn is a low-contrast color scheme for Vim. It's easy for your eyes and designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.


I really enjoy [Zenburn][0]. I noticed that the textmate port in the [VS Code marketplace][1] was lacking in many areas and hoped that I could align the syntax with the [Vim][2] version of zenburn and also theme a lot of the editor to follow the "Zenburn way". In the screenshots below, I'll show some comparisions with the textmate port, vim, and this theme.

## Comparisons

In this section, I'll first show the vim screenshot followed by the textmate version of that. Afterwards, I'll show the screenshot of this themes version of the language (so that you can see what was enhanced).

## Gratitude

This theme is in no way perfect. I based this theme on the [TextMate port][1]. I appreciate all of their work and that their theme existed so that I could create this. Thanks to [Zenburn][0] for their awesome theme that I was able to port to VS Code.
